# Here, the following tasks are implemented:
## Task 1

Create a class to describe a student in our group.
Class fields: first name, last name, passport number, group name (you can add your own fields if you wish - for example, age).
Create objects of this class for each student in our group.
Put all these objects in an array.
Go through the array with a for loop and output the information to the console.
## Task 2

Create a CreditCard class with the fields account number and current account balance.
Create one constructor with two parameters.
Create a TransferService class - a transfer service.
Add a method that allows you to add an amount to a credit card.
The method takes an amount and a card as input. Inside the method, create code that adds the amount passed to the method to the current amount on the card passed to the method.
Add a method that allows you to withdraw a certain amount from the card.
The method takes an amount and a card as input. Inside the method, write code that subtracts the transferred amount from the current amount on the passed card.
Add a method that displays current card information to the console.
Think over and implement various checks inside the withdrawal/addition methods: for example, a negative number was passed, 0 was passed, a request to withdraw an amount greater than what is currently on the card, and other possible checks.

Write a program that creates three objects of the CreditCard class with an account number and an initial amount specified.
Test scenario for verification:
Add money to the first two cards and withdraw from the third.
Display the current state of all three cards.
